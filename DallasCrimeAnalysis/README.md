# DallasCrimeAnalysis
I performed an analysis of city of Dallas crime data (as of the August, 2020). The goal of this analysis is to identify which areas (by zip code) have the highest amount of crime, and if there are any patterns in the distribution based on crime category.

This data visualization may be found on *[Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/)* at the following link: [What areas of Dallas have the highest amount of crime?](https://public.tableau.com/views/McCollumTermProject2/WhatareasofDallashavethehighestamountofcrime?:language=en&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link)
