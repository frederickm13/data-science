# ClimateChangeAnalysis (Unlocking Climate Solutions)
Full video presentation may be found on YouTube: [https://youtu.be/LJKhARLmn-s](https://youtu.be/LJKhARLmn-s).

As part of this project, I performed an analysis of CDP (www.cdp.net) climate survey data. This CDP climate survey data was retrieved from a Kaggle.com data competition (Unlocking Climate Solutions: https://www.kaggle.com/c/cdp-unlocking-climate-solutions/data). In order to help guide this project, I developed appropriate business questions and goals, as well as some more technical analytics goals. I have included each of these below: 

Business questions.
-	What are the biggest action points for cities and corporations to mitigate climate issues? 
-	What KPIs can be used to measure success of these action points? 

Business goals.
-	Identify primary action points for cities/corporations to mitigate climate issues.
-	Determine/develop KPIs to measure success towards the action points that were identified in phase one.

Analytics goals.
-	Analyze and perform exploratory analysis of CDP climate survey data and identify any significant patterns/trends.
-	Develop measurable KPIs based on the identified patterns/trends in phase one.

The objective of this project was to answer the above-mentioned business questions, as well as achieve the above-mentioned business and analytics goals. The outcome of this project was to produce measurable KPIs that cities and corporations can use to improve their sustainability footprint.
